echo "Once upon a time, my friend Sona and I were playing $NOUN1.  And all of a sudden we saw a giant $NOUN2.  It started to chase us all the way down $NOUN3.  It wasn't until we started $NOUN4, that it stopped chasing us and was mezmerized by our talents.  We quickly used this moment escape via $NOUN5.  That was not the last of our troubles though... the $NOUN2 had caught up with us!  We suddenly saw a $NOUN6 and used it to fight the $NOUN2 off.  It was a hard task but we finally had won.  We went out to celebrate and $NOUN7 the night away.  It was an $NOUN8 night."
